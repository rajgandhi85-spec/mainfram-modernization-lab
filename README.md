# Mainframe Modernization Lab

This is my personal learning lab for upgrading from a senior mainframe developer to a modernization-focused engineer and future architect.

## Focus Areas
- Mainframe DevOps (Git, CI/CD, automation)
- Cloud integration (APIs, serverless, messaging)
- Modernization patterns (COBOL → services)
- AI-assisted analysis (code, JCL, test generation)

## Current Status
- Environment setup completed
- Next: Add JCL templates and automation scripts

## Why This Matters
- Reduces manual effort and errors
- Prepares for modernization initiatives
- Builds reusable patterns for enterprise teams
